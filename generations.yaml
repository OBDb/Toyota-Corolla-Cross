    description: "The Toyota Corolla Cross represents the iconic nameplate's expansion into the rapidly growing subcompact/compact crossover segment, leveraging the Corolla's strong brand recognition while offering the higher riding position and versatility that have driven SUV popularity. Built on Toyota's TNGA-C platform shared with the Corolla sedan and hatchback, the Corolla Cross features more conventional SUV-like styling compared to the swoopier C-HR, with a practical upright profile, pronounced wheel arches, and a recognizable family resemblance to Toyota's larger RAV4 and Highlander SUVs. Measuring approximately 175.6 inches in length and 64.8 inches in height, the Corolla Cross slots between the C-HR and RAV4 in Toyota's lineup. Powertrain options vary by market but typically include a 2.0-liter Dynamic Force four-cylinder producing 169 horsepower paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) in standard models, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive optional. A hybrid variant introduced for the 2023 model year combines a 2.0-liter engine with three electric motors (two in front, one in rear for AWD models) for a combined 196 horsepower and significantly improved fuel economy. The interior features straightforward, practical design shared with other Corolla models but with a more commanding seating position and increased cargo spaceâ€”up to 25.5 cubic feet behind the rear seats, expanding to 65.5 cubic feet with seats folded. Technology includes standard Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 driver assistance features, a standard 7-inch or available 8-inch (later up to 10.5-inch) touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and available features including a power liftgate, wireless charging, and a 9-speaker JBL premium audio system. The Corolla Cross successfully targets the sweet spot in the market between the smaller, style-focused C-HR and the larger, more expensive RAV4, offering Corolla's reputation for reliability and value in a package that meets current consumer preferences for crossover styling and practicality."
